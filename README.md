# demo-project
This little example project to demo using Mediator design pattern to manage the communication between sub-components.

This way the HomeScreenPresenter can communicate with the sub-componenets through the mediator class,
and the sub-componenets can communicate with the HomeScreenPresenter through their respective delegate methods.
